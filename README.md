# Project #2: Autonomous Control
# Approximating the Closed-Loop Feedback Behaviour of a Robotic Leg

● Defined the plant input in MATLAB to be the motor torque at the hip joint and output as the leg rotation angle  
● Linearized equation of motion of the time-invariant system at its equilibrium point to account for under-damping  
● Tuned the PID controller to specify a settling time under 0.8s and an overshoot in step response of less than 10%
